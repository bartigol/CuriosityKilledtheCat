# AI-Powered Project Planning

Empower your project planning with our multi-agent AI system! In minutes, our system automates Work Breakdown Structures (WBS), simplifying complex projects while reducing both time and costs. Transform your idea and product development using intelligent, collaborative AI agents designed for efficient project management.

This project is a submission by **Bartek Nosalik's team** for the **lablab.ai Hackathon**.

## Quickstart

To interact with our endpoint, follow these steps:

1. Clone the following Replit:
   [CuriosityKilledTheCat](https://replit.com/@bartnosalik/CuriosityKilledTheCat#main.py)
   
2. Run the `main.py` file within the cloned Replit environment.

That's it! You're all set to experience the power of automated project planning using AI.

## Project Structure

The repository contains several important files:

- **flow.dag.yaml**: This file defines the workflow, specifying how different agents interact to accomplish tasks.
- **Jinja files**: These define the AI agents and their behavior. Each agent has its own logic for processing tasks within the flow.
- **Python files**: These are tools used by the agents to carry out specific operations.

By combining these components, the system manages projects intelligently and efficiently.

## About the Project

Our system leverages AI agents to:
- Automatically generate Work Breakdown Structures (WBS)
- Collaboratively handle tasks, reducing project complexity
- Optimize time and resource management, helping you meet deadlines efficiently

We hope you find it useful and look forward to hearing your feedback!
